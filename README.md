## Getting Started

To use the sequence diagram examples in this repository, you'll need to have PlantUML installed. PlantUML is an open-source tool that allows you to create UML diagrams from simple text-based descriptions.

To install PlantUML, you can visit the official PlantUML website (https://plantuml.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once PlantUML is installed, you can use any text editor or IDE to open and modify the PlantUML files in this repository.

## Example Files

Here's a brief description of the example files included in this repository:

- **000-header-title-footer.puml**: Demonstrates how to add headers, titles, and footers to your sequence diagrams.
- **0001-participants.puml**: Shows different ways to define participants in a sequence diagram.
- **0002-arrows.puml**: Illustrates the usage of arrows and arrow styles in your sequence diagrams.
- **0003-arrows-errors-sync-async.puml**: Explores various arrow types, including error handling, synchronous, and asynchronous messages.
- **0004-arrows-colors.puml**: Highlights how to use different colors for arrows in your sequence diagrams.
- **0005-notes.puml**: Demonstrates how to add explanatory notes and comments to your sequence diagrams.
- **0006-activation-flows.puml**: Shows the activation and deactivation of participants in sequence diagrams.
- **0007-conditional.puml**: Illustrates the usage of conditional statements in sequence diagrams.
- **0008-loop.puml**: Explains how to represent loop constructs in sequence diagrams.

Feel free to explore these example files and modify them according to your needs.

## Usage

To use a specific example, simply open the corresponding PlantUML file in your favorite text editor or IDE. Modify the contents of the file to suit your requirements. You can customize the diagram elements, such as participants, arrows, notes, and colors, as demonstrated in the example files.

After making changes, save the file and generate the diagram using PlantUML. The specific method for generating diagrams may vary depending on your installation. Typically, you can use the command-line interface or an integrated plugin if available.

For example, if you have PlantUML installed as a command-line tool, you can generate a PNG image of the diagram by running the following command:

```
plantuml example.puml
```

Replace `example.puml` with the filename of the PlantUML file you wish to render.
